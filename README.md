# Overview

As a software engineer, it will only ever benefit me to learn new programming languages and how to utilize different programming tools. With how vital smart phones have become in our society, I decided I wanted to dive into the world of mobile app developement, and since I have already dipped my toes into Kotlin, I decided to start my mobile app journey with kotlin and Android Studio.

This app is a basic calculator app that will take two numbers as input and then can either add them together, subtract one from the other, divide one by the other, or multiply one by the other.

The purpose for creating this app, honestly, was just to get to learn the basics of Android Studio by creating a very simple app.
